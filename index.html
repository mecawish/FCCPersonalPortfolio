  <p class="col-md-6">Hi, I'm <strong>Meliza</strong>, now considering myself as a web developer. I was an electronics engineer but decided to abandon my degree to get into web development. Just last year, I had my first job as a developer. That job introduced me to a lot of web technologies but JavaScript is the one I fell in love with. I'm continuously learning more about JavaScript and its full stack and aims to focus on React and Node.js. So while learning, this is where I'll put my personal projects. Right now, I'm preparing to start a React training program with <a href="http://amagiacademy.com/" target="_blank">Amagi Academy</a> sponsored by <a href="https://www.splitmedialabs.com/" target="_blank">SplitmediaLabs</a> that will hopefully make me a competent React front-end developer that I aspire to become.</p>
